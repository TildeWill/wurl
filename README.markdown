# Wurl

A Hypermedia API Playground.

* Great for demonstrating an API's functionality
* Useful for doing story acceptance when developing an API
* Gives pretty-printed output and the browser saves your input making it easy to reuse

Wurl is inspired by [hurl](http://hurl.it/), and the [Apigee Console](https://apigee.com/console/)

[Deployed to heroku](http://wurl.herokuapp.com) for your API pleasure

# Engines Helper

A Rails 2.3+ plugin that provides database migrations and asset support for 'engine' type plugins. Based on the original 'Engines' plugin for Rails prior to version 2.3. (Rails 2.3+ currently supports the loading of the entire plugin/app directory and plugin/config/routes.rb file natively.)

More information about engines in Rails 2.3 from James Adam: http://rails-engines.org/news/2009/02/02/engines-in-rails-2-3/

## Requirements

* A Rails 2.3+ application
* *nix environment with rsync
* Engine-ified plugin(s), or plugins that have /app, /public and/or config/routes.rb paths

## Usage

### Migrations

Use the provided rake task to sync up all migrations in plugins/**/db/migrate with the parent application:

    rake engines:sync:migrations

### Asset management

There are two ways the plugin loads plugin assets into the parent application:

**1.) The assets are auto loaded into the public directory (default)**

This is the default behavior. On initialization, the contents of each plugin public directory is moved into a separate folder in the parent application:

    public/plugin_assets/<plugin name>/<public directories>
    
If you keep your assets within the Rails standards of /images, /stylesheets and /javascripts, then the following helper methods are available in the parent application:

    image_tag( source, :plugin => 'plugin name' )
    javascript_include_tag( source, :plugin => 'plugin name' )
    stylesheet_link_tag( source, :plugin => 'plugin name' )

The code for these Rails extensions is from the original engines plugin.

If you are using the Haml gem or plugin and want to extend Sass to work with the
stylesheets in your public folder, you must use Haml 2.1+.

*Note: you probably want to add public/plugin_assets to your .gitignore file*

**2.) The assets are synced into the public directory on demand**

To use this method, turn autoloading off in environment.rb:

    EnginesHelper.autoload_assets = false
    
Then fire up the rake task when ever you need it to update the assets:

    rake engines:sync:assets

*Note: there is no namespace partitioning to this method. In other words, assets of the same name/path from different plugins will overwrite each other. Be careful.*


## Notes

Windows is not supported right now due to the dependency on rsync.

## Further development

This plugin has been spec'd and tested using Rspec.  For spec runs and further development, an Rspec enabled Rails 2.3+ application is required.

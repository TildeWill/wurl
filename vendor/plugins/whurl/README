== Whurl
An API Playground

== History
This tool was made initially to facilitate acceptance testing. Pasting in curl
commands was ugly and remembering the syntax was eating up space in my brain.
Whurl gives you a permalink to a curl command so you can share ir with your team. It also
pretty prints your responses so you can actually read the results.

== Installation
This bad boy is a plugin! So install it like one:
cd <your app>
script/plugin install git@github.com:TildeWill/whurl.git

You may also want to install the engines-helper plugin to copy your assets to the
public/plugin_assets directory whenever you restart your app.

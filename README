== Whurl
An API Playground

== History
This tool was made initially to facilitate acceptance testing. Pasting in curl
commands was ugly and remembering the syntax was eating up space in my brain.
Whurl gives you a permalink to a curl command so you can share ir with your team. It also
pretty prints your responses so you can actually read the results.
